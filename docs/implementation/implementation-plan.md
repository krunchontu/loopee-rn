# Loopee Feature Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation strategy for enhancing Loopee with user authentication, contribution systems, data verification, and social features.

## Overview

The implementation will address the following feature gaps:
- No user login/profile system for persistent preferences
- Limited social features (sharing, reporting incorrect info)
- No ability for users to add new toilets to the database
- No mechanism to correct inaccurate information
- No verification system for user-submitted data

## Phased Implementation

The development will follow a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Authentication Foundation
- **Timeline**: Weeks 1-2
- **Branch**: `feature/auth-foundation`
- **Description**: Implement Supabase Auth integration, user profiles, and authentication UI.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - User registration and login flows
  - Profile management
  - Preference storage
  - Session management
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Documentation**: [Link to auth-foundation.md]

### Phase 2: Contribution System
- **Timeline**: Weeks 3-4
- **Branch**: `feature/contribution-system`
- **Description**: Create systems for users to add, edit, and report toilet information.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Multi-step toilet submission form
  - Location picker integration
  - Toilet editing capabilities
  - Issue reporting system
- **Dependencies**: Authentication System
- **Documentation**: [Link to contribution-system.md]

### Phase 3: Verification System
- **Timeline**: Weeks 5-6
- **Branch**: `feature/verification-system`
- **Description**: Build community-driven verification process with moderation capabilities.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Submission review pipeline
  - Community voting mechanism
  - Trust algorithm
  - Admin dashboard
- **Dependencies**: Authentication System, Contribution System
- **Documentation**: [Link to verification-system.md]

### Phase 4: Social Features
- **Timeline**: Weeks 7-8
- **Branch**: `feature/social-features`
- **Description**: Add social interactions and content sharing capabilities.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Toilet sharing
  - Favorites system
  - User follows
  - Activity feeds
- **Dependencies**: Authentication System
- **Documentation**: [Link to social-features.md]

## Testing Strategy

Each phase will include:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for API interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

Details in [Link to testing-strategy.md]

## Deployment Plan

- Each feature will be merged to the `develop` branch after review
- Integration testing will be performed in the develop environment
- Release branches will be created for production deployments
- Feature flags will be used for gradual rollout where appropriate

## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Authentication integration issues | Medium | High | Early spike, thorough testing |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Performance testing, optimized queries |
| User adoption of contribution features | Medium | High | Intuitive UX, incentives |
| Abuse of contribution system | Medium | High | Rate limiting, verification system |

## Success Metrics

- User registration and retention rates
- Number and quality of toilet submissions
- Verification turnaround time
- User engagement with social features

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environments
2. Create feature branches
3. Begin implementation of Authentication Foundation
4. Schedule regular progress reviews
