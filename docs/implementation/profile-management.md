# Profile Management Implementation

## Overview

The profile management feature allows users to view and edit their profile information, change account settings, and manage their personal data. This document outlines the implementation details of the profile management system in the Loopee app.

## Components Structure

### Screens
1. **Profile Screen** (`src/app/profile/index.tsx`)
   - Main profile view showing user information and content
   - Displays user avatar, name, username, bio
   - Shows tabs for Reviews, Contributions, and Favorites
   - Links to Edit Profile and Account Settings screens

2. **Edit Profile Screen** (`src/app/profile/edit.tsx`)
   - Form for editing profile information (display name, username, bio)
   - Avatar upload functionality
   - Form validation and error handling

3. **Account Settings Screen** (`src/app/profile/settings.tsx`) 
   - Password management
   - Email preferences management
   - Account deletion option

### UI Components
1. **ProfileHeader** (`src/components/profile/ProfileHeader.tsx`)
   - Displays user avatar, name, username, and bio
   - Shows user stats (reviews, contributions, favorites)
   - Action buttons for editing profile and accessing settings

2. **AvatarUpload** (`src/components/profile/AvatarUpload.tsx`)
   - Handles image selection from device gallery
   - Provides visual feedback during upload process
   - Falls back to initials when no avatar is available
   - Image processing for optimal display

3. **ProfileForm** (`src/components/profile/ProfileForm.tsx`)
   - Form inputs for user profile data
   - Field validation for all inputs
   - Submission handling with error states

4. **AccountSettings** (`src/components/profile/AccountSettings.tsx`)
   - Password change form with validation
   - Email notification preferences toggles
   - Dangerous actions (account deletion) with confirmation

## Data Flow

### Profile Data

1. User profile data is loaded through the `AuthProvider` context
2. The `profile` object contains all user information (display_name, username, bio, etc.)
3. Updates to profile data are handled by the `updateProfile` method in `AuthProvider`
4. Profile data is persisted in Supabase's user_profiles table

### Authentication Integration

1. All profile screens verify authentication status before rendering content
2. Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
3. Password changes are handled through the `updatePassword` method in `AuthProvider`
4. Account deletion is simulated with signout (real implementation would delete the account)

## User Experience Details

### Form Validation

- Display name: Required, minimum 2 characters
- Username: Required, alphanumeric with underscores only, minimum 3 characters
- Bio: Optional, maximum 160 characters
- Password: Minimum 8 characters, must match confirmation

### Error Handling

- Form-level validation errors displayed inline
- API errors (e.g., failed updates) shown as banners
- Loading states displayed during async operations

### Navigation Flow

1. User accesses profile from bottom navigation
2. From profile, user can:
   - Navigate to Edit Profile screen
   - Navigate to Account Settings screen
3. Each sub-screen has a back button to return to the main profile

## Implementation Status

### Completed Features

1. **User Statistics Display**
   - Real statistics for reviews, contributions, and favorites are now displayed in the profile header
   - Database schema updated to track user statistics (reviews_count, contributions_count, favorites_count)
   - Automatic counters using database triggers to update statistics when related actions happen
   - Updated UserProfile interface to include all statistics fields

2. **Content Display Structure**
   - Created reusable ContentList component to display user content across different tabs
   - Type definitions for content items (UserReview, UserContribution, UserFavorite)
   - Empty state handling for tabs with no content
   - Preparation for data loading in future phases

### Pending Enhancements

1. **Content Sections** (Phase 2)
   - Implement actual data loading for user reviews, contributions, and favorites
   - Add item components for each content type
   - Add filtering and sorting options for content tabs
   - Implement pagination for content lists

2. **Account Management** (Phase 3)
   - Complete email preferences storage and functionality
   - Implement actual account deletion

3. **Avatar Storage** (Phase 4)
   - Replace mock avatar upload with real storage integration
   - Add image optimization for performance

4. **Social Features** (Phase 5)
   - Add following/follower functionality
   - Create database schema for social relationships
   - Implement profile sharing options

5. **Profile Verification** (Phase 6)
   - Add verification badges for trusted users
   - Create verification process flow
   - Admin interface for verification management

## Technical Notes

- Uses React Native Paper for UI components
- All forms employ controlled components pattern
- Data validation occurs both client-side and server-side
- Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes
- Avatar image processing uses Expo ImagePicker for cross-platform compatibility
