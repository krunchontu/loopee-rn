### Blockers: None

## Implementation Details

### Issue 1: Excessive Location and Toilet Refreshing
The app was experiencing annoying refreshes of location data and toilet lists due to:
1. Over-aggressive location tracking (every 10s or 10m)
2. Each location update triggering API calls without throttling
3. No caching mechanism or smart fetch logic
4. Excessive debug logs repeating within milliseconds

### Solution 1:
1. **Reduced Location Update Frequency**
   - Increased update interval from 10s to 60s
   - Increased distance interval from 10m to 100m
   - This significantly reduces location service battery usage

2. **Smart Toilet Data Fetching**
   - Added caching with 5-minute expiration
   - Implemented distance-based fetch threshold (100m)
   - Added smart fetch logic with Haversine distance calculation
   
3. **UI Optimizations**
   - Added loading indicator to show when data is being refreshed
   - Prevented unnecessary map movements during small location updates
   - Map only centers on first location fix or when user taps location button

4. **Log Throttling**
   - Added throttledLog method to debug utility with time-based filtering
   - Applied 60-second throttling to marker rendering logs
   - Applied 30-second throttling to location update logs
   - Applied 30-second throttling to toilet data cache status logs
   - Kept important logs (cache expiration, significant movement) unthrottled

### Issue 2: Authentication Session Persistence Problems
The app was experiencing authentication failures when submitting toilet reviews:
1. Invalid session expiration timestamp handling leading to forced logouts
2. Session refresh operations timing out after only 5 seconds
3. No retry mechanism for failed session refreshes
4. Inadequate handling of extreme timestamp values (far in past/future)
5. Users getting "Authentication check failed" errors during submissions

### Solution 2:
1. **Enhanced Session Validation**
   - Added robust timestamp validation for session expiration
   - Added needsForceRefresh flag to handle invalid timestamps
   - Increased validation timeout from 5s to 10s for slower connections

2. **Improved Session Refresh Mechanism**
   - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for session refresh
   - Added proper session verification after refresh to ensure validity
   - Increased refresh timeout from 5s to 12s for slower connections

3. **More Proactive Session Health Monitoring**
   - Increased session refresh threshold from 5 minutes to 10 minutes
   - Added verification step after session refresh to confirm success
   - Improved error categorization for better user feedback
   - Added handling for extremely invalid timestamps

4. **Better Error Handling**
   - Added specific error messages for different authentication failure scenarios
   - Enhanced debugging to capture more information about session issues
   - Improved user-facing error messages for clarity and actionability

### Issue 3: Frontend Duplicate Toilet Submissions
The app was creating duplicate toilet entries when users submitted the form:
1. Rapid button clicks caused multiple identical submissions within milliseconds
2. React's asynchronous state updates meant the button wasn't disabled fast enough
3. Multiple submission attempts occurred before the UI could update
4. Database received duplicate submissions with different IDs but identical content
5. User noticed duplicate entries in the log output

### Solution 3.1: Frontend Protection
1. **Synchronous Submission Guard**
   - Added `useRef` to track submission status synchronously
   - Implemented early return when submission is already in progress
   - Added dual protection with both sync (ref) and async (state) mechanisms
   
2. **Improved User Feedback**
   - Maintained existing visual disabled state on button
   - Added clear debug logging for prevented duplicate attempts
   - Ensured proper state tracking during async operations

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identified asynchronous state updates as the primary issue
   - Added comprehensive comments explaining the problem and solution
   - Ensured proper cleanup of submission status tracking in all code paths

### Issue 4: Backend Duplicate Toilet Submissions
Despite the frontend protection, duplicate submissions were still occurring at the service level:
1. Network/race conditions could trigger duplicate service calls
2. Identical submissions were processed by the backend as separate submissions
3. The eligibility check caused errors with a non-existent "polpermission" column
4. Each submission received a unique ID despite having identical content

### Solution 4: Backend Deduplication
1. **Content-Based Submission Tracking**
   - Added logic to generate unique fingerprints for submissions
   - Implemented in-memory tracking of recent submissions with timestamp
   - Created configurable time window (10s default) to prevent duplicates
   - Added memory cleanup to prevent unbounded growth of tracked submissions

2. **Early Duplicate Detection**
   - Added check at the start of submission process before database operations
   - Provided detailed error messages for duplicate submissions
   - Added logging for duplicate prevention events

3. **Database Fixes**
   - Created migration to fix the "polpermission" column error
   - Simplified the eligibility check function to avoid referencing non-existent columns
   - Added proper permissions and documentation

### Issue 5: Database Schema and Function Mismatch
The app was unable to approve toilet submissions due to schema issues:
1. The process_approved_submission() function referenced columns that didn't exist in the toilets table
2. The data format of submissions (JSON) didn't match the expected database column formats
3. There were camelCase vs snake_case mapping issues between submission fields and database columns
4. The location data was not being properly converted from JSON to PostGIS point format

### Solution 5: Database Schema Alignment
1. **Schema Enhancement**
   - Added missing columns to toilets table: description, address, building_name, etc.
   - Added proper foreign key references for submitted_by and last_edited_by
   - Added updated_at column with automatic trigger for change tracking
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing data

2. **Function Improvement**
   - Updated process_approved_submission() function to handle field mapping correctly
   - Added proper conversion of location data from JSON to PostGIS point
   - Implemented fallbacks for missing fields (e.g., name as description)
   - Fixed data type conversions for all fields

3. **Check Eligibility Improvement**
   - Reimplemented check_submission_eligibility() function without polpermission reference
   - Added proper rate limiting and eligibility checks (pending limit, daily limit)
   - Improved error messages for various eligibility scenarios
   - Added proper security context and permissions

### Issue 6: Database Migration Function Dependency Issue
The migration script failed when trying to apply the database schema fix due to:
1. PostgreSQL dependency constraints preventing direct function replacement
2. Trigger dependencies needing proper handling in migration scripts
3. Missing explicit trigger recreation after function updates
4. Lack of documentation for database function dependencies

### Solution 6: Database Migration Dependency Fix
1. **Dependency-Aware Function Replacement**
   - Modified migration script to first drop dependent triggers
   - Added proper sequence: drop trigger â†’ drop function â†’ create function â†’ recreate trigger
   - Added explicit comments explaining dependency handling

2. **Improved Migration Documentation**
   - Added detailed function comments explaining purpose and behavior
   - Documented the trigger-function relationship
   - Applied best practices for PostgreSQL migrations
  
3. **Comprehensive Testing Approach**
   - Added verification steps for the migration
   - Added detailed explanation for future migrations
   - Created documentation of the database schema and relationships

### Issue 7: Database Field Name Mismatch in Contribution Tracking
The toilets table insertion process was unable to successfully update user contribution counts due to:
1. The update_user_contribution_count() function referenced a field called "added_by" that didn't exist
2. The toilets table was using "submitted_by" as the field name for the user who submitted the toilet
3. This mismatch prevented proper incrementing of user contribution counts upon submission approval
4. The error occurred after fixing the previous schema issues

### Solution 7: Field Name Standardization
1. **Function Field Reference Update**
   - Updated the update_user_contribution_count() function to use "submitted_by" instead of "added_by"
   - Added proper dependency handling by first dropping the trigger that uses this function
   - Explicitly recreated the trigger after updating the function
   - Added clear documentation about the field naming

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Applied the same dependency-aware approach used in previous fixes
   - Properly sequenced the drop and recreation of dependent objects
   - Documented the approach for future reference

3. **Documentation Improvement**
   - Added comments explaining the purpose of the contribution count update function
   - Documented the trigger-function relationship
   - Updated tracking documentation to reflect this fix

### Issue 8: Multiple Dependent Triggers in Contribution Tracking
The migration script was still failing when trying to update the contribution tracking system due to:
1. Multiple dependent triggers existed (insert and delete) but we were only accounting for one
2. The trigger name we were using was incorrect (update_user_stats_on_toilet_insert)
3. The actual trigger names were update_user_contribution_count_insert and update_user_contribution_count_delete
4. We needed to handle incrementing and decrementing of user contribution counts separately
5. The error occurred after fixing the field name mismatch

### Solution 8: Complete Trigger Dependency Management
1. **Comprehensive Dependency Detection**
   - Modified script to drop both the insert and delete triggers first
   - Used the correct trigger names from the database error message
   - Added proper sequence for dropping and recreating all dependent objects

2. **Complete Contribution Tracking System**
   - Added a separate function for decrementing contribution counts on toilet deletion
   - Implemented safeguards to prevent negative contribution counts using GREATEST(0, count-1)
   - Recreated both triggers with their original names
   - Added proper documentation for both the increment and decrement functions

3. **Improved Error Resilience**
   - Added NULL checks in the decrement function to handle cases where submitted_by is NULL
   - Maintained proper security context for all database operations
   - Added clear comments explaining the purpose of each function and trigger
