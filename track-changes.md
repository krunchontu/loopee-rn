## 2025-05-17 01:10 UTC+8 - Toilet Map Visibility Diagnosis

**Action:** Diagnosed issue with only two toilets showing on map
**Files Modified:**
- src/services/supabase.ts (Added diagnostic logging)
- src/stores/toilets.ts (Temporarily modified validation)
- src/utils/clustering.ts (Added diagnostic reporting)
- src/components/map/MapView.tsx (Modified marker rendering for diagnosis)

**Investigation Results:**
1. Database query is returning exactly 2 toilets (Orchard MRT and Plaza Singapura)
2. Both toilets have valid coordinates and are correctly displayed on map
3. No toilets are being incorrectly filtered out by validation
4. Diagnostic logs confirmed all toilets from database are properly processed

**Root Cause:**
The issue is not a technical bug but simply that there are only 2 toilet records in the database that match the search criteria (within the specified radius of the user's location).

Through diagnostic logging, we confirmed the complete data flow from database to map display works correctly.
