**Technical Details:**
- Replaced @shopify/flash-list dependency with React Native's built-in FlatList
- Maintained all existing functionality (pull-to-refresh, error handling, etc.)
- Preserved the same API interface for backward compatibility

**Next Steps:**

- Implement consistent separators across all list views
- Add subtle animations for list item interactions

**Action:** Refactored `MapHeader` in `src/app/(guest)/map.tsx` for a cleaner look.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(guest)/map.tsx` (updated headerStyle options)
**Verification:**
Visual change to map screen header (white background, dark text, subtle border).

## 2025-05-17 23:02 UTC+8 - Iteration 2 (UI/UX Refactor - Map Screen & Modal)
**Action:** Simplified state management for modal visibility in `src/app/(guest)/map.tsx` by using `selectedToilet` from Zustand store. Updated `src/components/toilet/ModalToiletSheet.tsx` to accept and use `selectedToilet` prop.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(guest)/map.tsx` (removed local `isModalVisible` state, modified `handleMapMarkerPress`, `handleModalClose`, and props passed to `ModalToiletSheet`)
- `src/components/toilet/ModalToiletSheet.tsx` (updated `ModalToiletSheetProps`, added logic to display `selectedToilet`)
**Verification:**
Modal visibility should now be correctly driven by the `selectedToilet` state in the Zustand store. TypeScript error for `selectedToilet` prop should be resolved.

## 2025-05-17 23:04 UTC+8 - Iteration 3 (UI/UX Refactor - Map Screen Error Handling)
**Action:** Refactored location error display in `src/app/(guest)/map.tsx` to be a less intrusive banner. Removed unused `LocationErrorView` component and its props. Addressed ESLint style ordering issues.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(guest)/map.tsx` (Removed `LocationErrorView` component and `LocationErrorViewProps` type. Integrated `ErrorState` directly with banner styling. Reordered styles in `StyleSheet.create`.)
**Verification:**
Location errors should now display as a banner at the top of the map screen. ESLint errors for unused variable and style ordering should be resolved.

## 2025-05-17 23:06 UTC+8 - Iteration 4 (UI/UX Refactor - AnimatedMarker Style)
**Action:** Updated `AnimatedMarker.tsx` to give individual toilet markers a "pin" shape for better visual distinction from clusters. Changed icon to üìç. Corrected color import path and usage of `palette.transparent`. Addressed ESLint style issues.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/map/AnimatedMarker.tsx` (Modified marker rendering logic and styles for a new pin shape, updated icon, fixed color imports and usage, removed unused styles, and reordered styles).
**Verification:**
Individual toilet markers should now appear as pins. TypeScript errors related to `transparent` color should be resolved. ESLint errors for unused styles and style ordering should be resolved.

## 2025-05-17 23:07 UTC+8 - Iteration 5 (UI/UX Refactor - Cluster Marker Style)
**Action:** Updated cluster marker style in `AnimatedMarker.tsx` for better visual differentiation and readability.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/map/AnimatedMarker.tsx` (Adjusted size, background color, and text style for cluster markers).
**Verification:**
Cluster markers should now use the secondary brand color (teal), be slightly larger, and have more readable count text.

## 2025-05-17 23:10 UTC+8 - Iteration 6 (UI/UX Refactor - Map Controls)
**Action:** Refactored map controls in `src/components/map/MapView.tsx`. "My Location" button is now a FAB. Location permission request view is restyled.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/map/MapView.tsx` (Imported `Pressable` and `createShadow`. Updated styles for `permissionErrorContainer`, `errorText`, `permissionButton`. Added `locationFab` and `locationFabIcon` styles. Replaced "My Location" button with `Pressable` FAB. Removed duplicate style definition.)
**Verification:**
"My Location" button should appear as a FAB. Location permission request UI should be updated. TypeScript and ESLint errors related to these changes should be resolved.

## 2025-05-17 23:13 UTC+8 - Iteration 7 (UI/UX Refactor - Custom Map Style)
**Action:** Added a simple desaturated custom map style to `src/components/map/MapView.tsx`.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/map/MapView.tsx` (Defined `customMapStyle` array and applied it to the `MapView` component).
**Verification:**
The map should now appear slightly desaturated, making markers more prominent.

## 2025-05-17 23:14 UTC+8 - Iteration 8 (UI/UX Refactor - ModalToiletSheet Header & Handle)
**Action:** Refined `ModalHeader` in `ModalToiletSheet.tsx` to use an icon for the close button and updated `ModalHandle` to be more subtle.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/toilet/ModalToiletSheet.tsx` (Updated `ModalHeader`'s close button to an icon, adjusted styles for `closeButton`, `closeButtonIcon`, `countText`, and `handle`).
**Verification:**
Modal header close button should be an '‚úï' icon. Modal pull handle should be thinner and lighter.

## 2025-05-17 23:18 UTC+8 - Iteration 9 (UI/UX Refactor - ToiletList States)
**Action:** Refined skeleton loading state in `ToiletList.tsx` to better mimic `ToiletCard` structure. Updated empty state to be a simpler text message. Corrected imports and addressed TS/ESLint errors in `LoadingState.tsx` and `ToiletList.tsx`.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/shared/LoadingState.tsx` (Enabled `children` prop, updated `SkeletonList` props, corrected color imports and usage, fixed style ordering).
- `src/components/toilet/ToiletList.tsx` (Imported `LoadingState` and `borderRadius`. Implemented `renderSkeletonItem` for `SkeletonList`. Changed empty state to use styled `Text` components. Fixed style ordering).
**Verification:**
Skeleton loading in `ToiletList` should now show a more detailed representation. Empty state should be a simple text message. Errors related to these changes should be resolved.

## 2025-05-17 23:23 UTC+8 - Iteration 10 (UI/UX Refactor - ToiletCard Visuals)
**Action:** Overhauled `ToiletCard.tsx` for improved layout, visual hierarchy, and polish.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/toilet/ToiletCard.tsx` (Adjusted styles for content, distance, location, mainInfo, metaInfo, name, nameRow, pressed, ratingContainer, reviewCount. Added distanceRow and metaIcon styles. Corrected imports and ESLint style ordering issues.)
**Verification:**
`ToiletCard` should have a cleaner, more modern appearance with better visual hierarchy.

## 2025-05-18 12:45 UTC+8 - Iteration 11 (Fix Nested NavigationContainer Error)
**Action:** Removed nested NavigationContainer from ResponsiveNavigation component.
**Files Modified:**

**Verification:**

## 2025-05-18 13:27 UTC+8 - Iteration 12 (Fix VirtualizedList Nesting Error)
**Action:** Refactored ModalizeToiletSheet.tsx to use Modalize's built-in FlatList support instead of nesting ToiletList component.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/toilet/ModalizeToiletSheet.tsx` (Replaced nested ToiletList with direct flatListProps implementation)
**Verification:**
Fixed "VirtualizedLists should never be nested inside plain ScrollViews" error by eliminating the nested scrollable container structure.

**Key Changes:**
1. Used Modalize's native `flatListProps` support to directly render toilet items
2. Moved error and loading state handling directly into ModalizeToiletSheet

4. Enhanced documentation to explain the implementation decision
5. Improved performance by reducing component nesting

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extracted and reused the same rendering logic and styling from ToiletList
- Maintained identical appearance and behavior for users
- Added proper separation of concerns for error and loading states
- Implemented the same memoization strategies for optimal performance
