## 2025-05-17 09:29 UTC+8 - Fixed Map UI/UX Issues

**Action:** Fixed critical UI/UX issues with the map interface
**Files Modified:**
- src/app/(guest)/map.tsx (Improved BottomSheet visibility and interaction)
- src/components/map/MapView.tsx (Enhanced marker interaction)

**Changes Detail:**
1. Fixed Bottom Sheet visibility:
   - Added proper inset handling for Android navigation bar to prevent bottom sheet from being hidden
   - Ensured minimum height accounts for system UI elements
   - Implemented dynamic height calculation based on device dimensions

2. Enhanced map marker interactions:
   - Improved toilet selection handling with better error checking
   - Added explicit sheet expansion when a marker is pressed
   - Enhanced logging for better debugging
   - Fixed event propagation to ensure proper response when markers are tapped

**Rationale:**
Users reported two key issues: the bottom sheet wasn't visible on some Android devices, and tapping toilet markers didn't display information. These fixes improve the core map experience by:
- Ensuring the bottom sheet is always visible and accessible regardless of device
- Providing expected feedback when users tap on toilet markers
- Maintaining the application's visual hierarchy with proper positioning

**Next Steps:**
- Enhance marker visibility with improved colors and iconography
- Add animation when transitioning between different toilet selections
- Implement visual indicators for the currently selected toilet

- Created src/foundations/colors.ts (Enhanced color system with semantic colors)
- Created src/foundations/typography.ts (Typography system with semantic text styles)
- Created src/foundations/layout.ts (Spacing, shadows, and layout tokens)
- Created src/foundations/animations.ts (Animation duration, easing, and utilities)
- Created src/foundations/index.ts (Unified design system exports)

**Changes Detail:**
1. Migrated from basic color definitions to comprehensive design token system:
   - Expanded color palette with semantic color naming
   - Created robust typography system with consistent text styles
   - Standardized spacing, shadows, and layout values
   - Added animation utilities with consistent timing and easing
   - Unified exports for simpler imports across the app

**Rationale:**
A robust design system foundation is essential for consistent UI/UX across the app. This structured approach will:
- Improve visual consistency
- Simplify component development
- Enhance design-to-code workflow
- Support better accessibility through consistent patterns
- Make future design updates easier to implement
- Reduce duplication and style inconsistencies

**Next Steps:**
- Apply design tokens to existing components

2. Both toilets have valid coordinates and are correctly displayed on map
3. No toilets are being incorrectly filtered out by validation
4. Diagnostic logs confirmed all toilets from database are properly processed

**Root Cause:**
The issue is not a technical bug but simply that there are only 2 toilet records in the database that match the search criteria (within the specified radius of the user's location).

**Verification:**
Through diagnostic logging, we confirmed the complete data flow from database to map display works correctly.
