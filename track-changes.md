# Map Location Center Button Fix - 5/24/2025

## Problem
When clicking on the center location FAB (Floating Action Button), nothing happened despite a log entry being generated.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the ref forwarding between components. The `MapWithBottomSheet` component had a `mapRef` but it wasn't properly connected to the actual MapView instance in the `CustomMapView` component.

## Changes Made

1. Added proper ref forwarding to `CustomMapView` component using React's `forwardRef`:
   - Modified `MapView.tsx` to use `forwardRef` and properly connect the internal MapView ref to the forwarded ref
   - Implemented a robust ref handling mechanism to handle both callback refs and object refs

2. Updated `MapWithBottomSheet.tsx` to:
   - Pass its mapRef to the `CustomMapView` component
   - Add improved error logging when centering fails
   - Add animation duration for smoother transitions (500ms)

3. Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the location centering process

## Verification
The center location button now properly animates the map to the user's current location with a smooth transition.
