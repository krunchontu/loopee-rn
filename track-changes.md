# Track Changes

## 2025-05-24 02:26 (Asia/Singapore, UTC+8:00) - Iteration 3
**Action:** Fixed duplicate back arrow on registration screen

**Problem:**
A duplicate back arrow was appearing on the registration and other authentication screens, causing visual clutter and potential user confusion.

**Solution Approach:**
Added additional header configuration options to completely suppress any default navigation elements.

**Technical Implementation:**
1. Updated auth layout (`src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx`) with multiple header control properties:
   - Added `headerBackVisible: false` to explicitly hide the default back button
   - Added `headerLeft: () => null` to remove any items that might appear in the header left position
   - Added `navigationBarHidden: true` for complete suppression of the navigation bar

**Files Modified:**
- src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx
  - Enhanced Stack screenOptions with additional header control properties
  - Added comprehensive comments explaining each setting's purpose

**UI/UX Improvements:**
- Eliminated redundant navigation elements (duplicate back arrows)
- Reduced visual clutter on authentication screens
- Streamlined the navigation experience
- Ensured only our custom AppHeader controls are visible

**Verification:**
All default navigation elements are now properly suppressed, leaving only the intentionally designed custom header components.

## 2025-05-24 02:23 (Asia/Singapore, UTC+8:00) - Iteration 2
**Action:** Fixed "login" route name displaying on login screen

**Problem:**
After fixing the "(auth)" group label, another unwanted label "login" (the route path name) was still displaying on the authentication screens.

**Solution Approach:**
Set an empty title in the Stack screenOptions to prevent route names from being displayed in the UI.

**Technical Implementation:**
1. Updated auth layout (`src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx`) to add `title: ""` in the Stack screenOptions
2. This prevents any route path names from appearing in the UI

**Files Modified:**
- src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx
  - Added `title: ""` to Stack screenOptions to hide route names
  - Added clarifying comment explaining the purpose of this setting

**UI/UX Improvements:**
- Removed confusing "login" text from authentication screens
- Further cleaned up the interface for a more professional appearance
- Maintained clear visual hierarchy with only the meaningful "Sign In" title showing

**Verification:**
The empty title setting ensures that no route names are displayed in the UI, providing a cleaner authentication experience.

## 2025-05-24 02:20 (Asia/Singapore, UTC+8:00) - Iteration 1
**Action:** Fixed "(auth)" text displaying at top of login screen

**Problem:**
The Expo Router file system-based routing was causing the group directory name "(auth)" to appear at the top of authentication screens, creating a poor user experience.

**Solution Approach:**
Modified the navigation stack configuration to hide all default headers and rely solely on the custom AppHeader component.

**Technical Implementation:**
1. Updated root layout (`src/app/_layout.tsx`) to set `headerShown: false` globally in the Stack screenOptions
2. Removed redundant `headerShown: false` setting in auth layout (`src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx`)
3. Enhanced documentation in the AppHeader component to clarify its role as the primary header that replaces the default React Navigation header

**Files Modified:**
- src/app/_layout.tsx 
  - Set `headerShown: false` globally for all screens
  - Added documentation comments explaining the header hiding approach
- src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx
  - Updated comments to acknowledge the global header setting
  - Simplified configuration to avoid redundancy
- src/components/shared/AppHeader.tsx
  - Enhanced documentation to clarify the component's role in preventing group names from appearing

**UI/UX Improvements:**
- Removed confusing "(auth)" text from login screen
- Maintained consistent visual hierarchy with clean header presentation
- Improved overall aesthetic and professionalism of authentication screens

**Verification:**
The change eliminates the "(auth)" text while preserving the intended "Sign In" heading, creating a cleaner, more professional user experience on authentication screens.
